Why is it Important?


Delays in mobilizing qualified healthcare staff = preventable deaths



No central, verified platform to connect professionals with humanitarian organizations



Fragmented data and lack of coordinated deployment mechanisms



Ad hoc rosters limit local ownership, reinforcing aid dependence and hindering capacity building
 
 





Objective


To establish a secure, global roster of licensed and experienced healthcare professionals that serves as a facilitating platform for connecting individuals to organizations needing skilled personnel in humanitarian and conflict settings
